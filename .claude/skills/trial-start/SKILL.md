description: Start a continuous trial (background cycling loop)
---

Start a trial with continuous cycling:

```bash
make trial-start
```

This starts the background cycling loop. The arm will continuously cycle between resting and pour-prep positions until stopped. Use `/trial-status` to check progress and `/trial-stop` to end the trial.
